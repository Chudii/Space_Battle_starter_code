# Space Battle 

Earth has been attacked by a horde of aliens! You are the captain of the USS Pew Pew, on a mission to destroy every last alien ship.

Battle the aliens as you try to destroy them with your lasers.

There are six alien ships. The aliens' weakness is that they are too logical and attack one at a time: they will wait to see the outcome of a battle before deploying another alien ship. Your strength is that you have the initiative and get to attack first. Luckikly, you  have targeting lasers and can attack the aliens in any order. After you have destroyed a ship, you have the option to make a hasty retreat.

## A game round looks like this: 

#### - You attack the current alien ship
#### - If the ship survives, it attacks you
#### - If you survive, you can attack the ship again (or choose a new target)
#### - If it survives, it attacks you again … etc
#### - If you destroy the ship, you have the option to attack the next ship or to retreat
#### - If you retreat the game is over (perhaps leaving the game open for further developments or options)
#### - You win the game if you destroy all of the aliens
#### - You lose the game if you are destroyed

## Bonus round: 

#### If you win, you have the ability to level up

#### - Your have been given new upgrades to your ship
#### - A rogue fighter ship appears for you to battle

## Extras 

#### - Your ship has 3 missles that do `10` damage each when they land
